    1. Players alternate turns placing a stone of their color (white or black) on an empty intersection on a 15Ã—15 Go board.
    2. Black plays first. The first player's (Black's) first stone must be placed in the center of the board.
    3. The second player's (White's) first stone may be placed anywhere on the board.
    4. The first player's second stone must be placed at least three intersections away from the first stone (two empty intersections in between the two stones).
    5. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken line of five stones of their color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
    6. If the board is completely filled and no one can form a line of 5 stones, then the game ends in a draw.
